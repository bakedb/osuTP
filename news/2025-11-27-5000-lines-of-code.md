# 5000 Lines of Code!

## osuTP has surpassed 5000 lines of code!
Over the past few days of development, the osuTP project's ```index.html``` file that contains all of the HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript code has surpassed 5000 lines! This is one of the largest projects that I have worked on, and even though nobody has seen it yet, this article is more of a self-reflection for when people finally do experience the work that I have put into this website. I hope that you enjoy it so far!

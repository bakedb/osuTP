# Version 0.8 is out!

## The next version of the stable website has been released!
Release v0.8 has a bit to unpack, so let's get into all of the changes!

The Windows 10 theme has been renamed to just Windows, and there is a bit of a realistic secret hidden inside of the theme. Don't worry, it will only take about 5 seconds to find. Just apply the theme and you'll see why I hate that operating system.

The Live Brackets tab was taken away only for admins to see some time ago, but now it's back and actually functional!

Previously, when registering, a piece of data would be stored in your browser's memory, kind of like a cookie, and the data could only be retrieved from that browser on that computer. But that is true no more! The registration form now gives you an encoded string of characters that you can paste into the decoder in the tools tab, and it will work no matter what!

Of course, with this change, the registration form has been stripped down significantly so that the string of characters that you are given is not too long.

Lastly, the text on the home page has been slightly modified to reflect how everything works now.

That's all for this release. If you want to see the most recent features in development, head over to the osu!TP Dev version of the site by going down to the bottom of the web page and hitting the "Development Version" text that is right below "Try the latest features:".

See you next release!
